# Gleamveil

This is a reference for my personal RPG setting.

The CSS, JavaScript, HTML template, and build script of this project were created with the assistance of large language models.

Large language models were  **not** involved in the creation of the content for this project. All stories, history, mechanics, deities, geography, lore, etc. are original work. Some visual elements (such as maps) are temporary placeholders.
